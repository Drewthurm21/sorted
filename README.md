#### Throughout all phases, this documentation will be updated to guide users on what is new, challenges I've faced, and solutions I've come up with. It will include instructions on how to use the platform effectively, or clone and deploy it on multiple platforms.

# Sorted_Project Overview:

- **Purpose:**

  - The primary purpose of the "algoVIs" project is to provide a platform for learning about commonly used algorithms in sorting. Additionally the project aims to build, array manipulation, tree and graph traversal, and linked list operations, a pathfinding algorithm visualizer in the future.

- **Target Audience:**
  - The target audience includes computer science students, coding bootcamp participants, and anyone interested in learning and mastering algorithms. The project will also serve as a valuable addition to your professional portfolio.

# Technologies:

- **Front-End:**

  - Next.js with TypeScript will be used for building the front-end of the website.
  - Tailwind and SaSS modules will be employed for styling and design.
  - headlessUI will provide some menu components for ease of use.
  - Framer Motion will be used to enhance the user experience with animations and transitions.

- **Back-End:**
  - None for now.

# MVP Features:

- **Algorithm Visualization:**

  - Users will be able to visually understand how sorting algorithms work through animations and interactive representations.

- **Algorithm Selection:**

  - Users can choose from a list of sorting algorithms to visualize and learn about.

- **Input Options:**

  - Various input options will be available, allowing users to input their own data or select from predefined datasets.

- **User Controls:**

  - Users will have control over the visualization process, with options to start, pause, reset, and step through the sorting algorithm's execution.

- **Algorithm Write-ups:**

  - Detailed explanations and code samples for each algorithm will be provided to help users understand the underlying logic.

- **Code Samples:**
  - Implementation examples will be given for JavaScript and Python, to start.

# Project Phases:

- **Array Sorting Visualizations:**

  - The first phase will focus on implementing a few fundamental array sorting algorithms and creating write-ups for each, then implementing visualizations for each sorting algorithm. The first algorithms implemented will be Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Insertion Sort, and Quick Sort.

- **Pathfinding Visualizer (Future):**

  - The next phase of the project will involve building a pathfinding algorithm visualizer to explore algorithms like Dijkstra's and A\* for navigation and optimization.

- **Expansion to Other Algorithms:**
  - After completing the initial phase and path-finding algorithms, the project will expand to include visualizations and explanations for algorithms related to trees, graphs, and linked lists.

# Design and User Interface:

- The user interface will be intuitive and user-friendly, with a clean layout. Algorithm selection, input options, and user controls will be easily accessible via the navigation and sidebars.
- Visualizations will be prominently displayed to enhance the learning experience. Algorithm write-ups and code samples will be presented alongside the visualization area for reference and learning.

# Testing Strategy:

- Rigorous testing will be conducted on various browsers and devices to ensure compatibility. Functional test sets will be written and performed to verify the correctness of algorithms and their visualizations.
